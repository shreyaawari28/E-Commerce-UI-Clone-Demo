# E-Commerce-UI-Clone-Demo (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
**E-Commerce-UI-Clone-Demo** is a **static front-end clone of a modern e-commerce homepage**, built entirely using **HTML and CSS**.

This repository contains a **complete e-commerce UI layout**, including a navigation bar, secondary menu panel, hero section, product shop sections, and a fully structured multi-level footer.  
The purpose of this project is to practice **real-world UI layout replication**, page structuring, and styling using **pure HTML and CSS**, without JavaScript.

This is a **UI-focused clone**, not a functional e-commerce application.
