# E-Commerce-UI-Clone-Demo (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
**E-Commerce-UI-Clone-Demo** is a **static front-end clone of a modern e-commerce homepage**, built entirely using **HTML and CSS**.

This repository contains a **complete e-commerce UI layout**, including a navigation bar, secondary menu panel, hero section, product shop sections, and a fully structured multi-level footer.  
The purpose of this project is to practice **real-world UI layout replication**, page structuring, and styling using **pure HTML and CSS**, without JavaScript.

This is a **UI-focused clone**, not a functional e-commerce application.

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Modern top navigation bar  
- Logo, delivery location, search bar, account, orders, and cart sections  
- Secondary navigation panel with menu and category options  
- Hero section with background image and informational banner  
- Product shop section with multiple category cards  
- Card layout implemented using Flexbox with wrapping  
- Reusable card components for scalability  
- “Back to top” footer panel  
- Multi-column footer with informational links  
- Footer branding section  
- Legal and copyright section  
- Hover effects and consistent e-commerce color theme

## 🧪 How It Works
The UI is divided into structured sections:

- **Header & Navbar**: Uses Flexbox to align navigation elements horizontally.
- **Panel Section**: Secondary menu bar for quick navigation links.
- **Hero Section**: Full-width background image with a centered message overlay.
- **Shop Section**: Product categories displayed as cards using Flexbox and `flex-wrap`.
- **Footer**: Built in multiple layers, including navigation links, branding, and legal information.

All layout behavior, styling, and positioning are handled entirely using CSS.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- Search bar, links, and buttons are non-functional  
- Layout is not fully responsive for smaller devices  
- Static UI clone created purely for learning and practice  

These limitations are intentional.
